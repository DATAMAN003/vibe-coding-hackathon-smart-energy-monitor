# Smart Energy Monitor - The Vibe Coding Hackathon Submission

## Project Summary (200 words)

**Smart Energy Monitor** is an AI-powered home energy monitoring system that helps households reduce energy consumption and costs through intelligent analysis and personalized recommendations. Built entirely with Cursor and Kiro's AI-assisted development tools, this project demonstrates the power of modern AI development workflows in creating sustainable solutions.

**The Problem**: Most households have no visibility into their energy consumption patterns, leading to wasted electricity and higher bills. Traditional energy monitoring solutions either require expensive hardware or compromise user privacy by sending data to the cloud.

**The Solution**: A complete local energy monitoring system that uses current transformers and AI analysis to provide real-time insights without any cloud dependency. The system monitors individual devices, identifies usage patterns, and delivers actionable recommendations to reduce energy waste.

**Climate Impact**: By helping households reduce energy consumption by 10-20%, this system can significantly reduce carbon footprint. When scaled, it has the potential to save millions of kilowatt-hours annually and reduce CO2 emissions.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time energy monitoring with hardware sensors
- AI-powered pattern recognition and insights
- 100% local operation (no cloud dependency)
- Web-based dashboard for easy access
- Personalized energy-saving recommendations
- Cost tracking and projections

**Tools Used**: Built entirely with Cursor's AI code completion and Kiro's spec-to-code development approach, demonstrating how modern AI tools can accelerate sustainable technology development.
